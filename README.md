Classical Monte Carlo for $S_n$ model on hypertree lattice

To Answer:
* Is the critical point of the $S_n$ model controled by $n$-state Potts?
* What is the phase diagram (how to define?)? How does free energy scales in each phase?
* Pushing to $n\to 1$ limit, what can we say about von Neuman entropy?
