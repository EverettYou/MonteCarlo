    "* **Lattice**: we will only consider *bipartite* lattice, on which the block Gibbs sampling can be carried out.\n",
    " * The bipartite lattice contains two **sublattices** labeled by *A* and *B*.\n",
    " * The **boundary**, labeled by *C*, refers to the sites that will not be updated in Monte Carlo. The boundary configuration is fixed by the boundary condition and will not be updated. \n",
    "* **Group**: on each site, the degree of freedom is a permutation group element $g_i\\in S_n$, which we will called the \"spin\" hereinafter.\n",
    " * Each spin state will be represented as a vector in the canonical representation of $S_n$. For example, for $S_2$ group: $|()\\rangle=(1,0)^\\intercal$, $|(12)\\rangle=(0,1)^\\intercal.$\n",

    "The basic idea of importance sampling is to set up a suitable Markov chain that draws configurations according to the Boltzmann weight\n",
    "$$P[g] = \\frac{e^{-H[g]}}{Z}.$$\n",
    "There are two classes of update schemes:\n",
    "* Local update algorithms (Metropolis, **Heat-Bath**)\n",
    "* Cluster update algorithms (Swendsen-Wang Cluster, Wolff Cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster update greately reduces the dynamic scaling at the critical point, which speed up the convergence in the critical region. Cluster update works well for Potts model, where the spins interacts via delta function: such that the domain wall between all different spins are of the same tension (energy). In the Wolff cluster algorithm, a site is first choosen, and neighboring sites of the same spin can attach to the cluster with probability $p$ (sites of different spins should not attach), and finally the whole cluster is flipped. The transition rate can satisfy the detail balance because the intereial weight is the same ($=p^{C-1}$ where $C$ is number of cluster site, this is because the cluster is grown following a tree, and all trees are equivalent in bond number if the site number is fixed), so the only difference is on the boundary. There are two types of cluster boundaries: boudaries between different spins (of tension 0) and boundary between same spins (of tension $-\\ln p$). After flipping, the two types of boundary will switch their positions, so it can match the detail balance condition. More precisely, the partition function for $n$-state Potts model can be cast into\n",
    "$$Z\\propto\\sum_{\\text{config}}p^{\\text{#link}}n^{\\text{#cluster}}.$$\n",
    "This is due to the nice delta function structure. However for our $S_n$ model, the delta interaction is soften in some sense. Then the partition function no longer has the nice link and cluster structure, which make it hard to do cluster update.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it remains a question of <font color='red'>how to design a cluster update algorithm for $S_n$ model</font>, we will try the local update first, in particular the heat-bath update. The current code uses **block Gibbs sampling** + **heat-bath update**, alternatively sampling on A and B sublattices.\n",
